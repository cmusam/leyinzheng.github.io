Hello! I’m Christina Zheng. I work at the intersection of data, healthcare, and business. I focus on how healthcare decisions are actually made and carried out.

I’ve built analytics and commercial strategy for healthcare companies, from go-to-market planning to data platforms and physician targeting. My work is about turning data into decisions that matter for patients, providers, and systems.

I care deeply about how healthcare works in practice. How systems scale. How organizations operate. And how incentives shape outcomes.
