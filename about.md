Hello! I’m Leyin Zheng. I work at the intersection of data, healthcare, and business.

I’ve spent the last few years building analytics and commercial strategy for healthcare companies, from go-to-market planning to data platforms and physician targeting.

More recently, I’ve worked with early-stage healthcare teams on investing, diligence, and company building.

I care about how data drives real decisions in healthcare — how systems scale, how organizations operate, and how incentives shape outcomes.
