**UltraLinQ (<a href="https://www.ultralinq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ultralinq.com</a>)** is a cloud-based PACS platform.

PACS stands for Picture Archiving and Communication System. It is used to store, view, and share medical images. Before PACS, medical images were literal films. They were slow to produce, lossy, and had to be physically carried between providers. PACS digitized this process.

UltraLinQ gives clients the ability to read, store, report, and archive medical imaging anytime and from anywhere with an internet connection. Its clients include cardiology practices, hospitals, imaging centers, imaging schools, and multi-site healthcare systems.

**My view** -- Medical imaging infrastructure is a mature market. Traditional PACS systems are often built around hospitals and legacy workflows. UltraLinQ’s focus on cloud access, speed, and sharing feels aligned with how care is increasingly delivered across distributed settings. It’s a practical wedge into a critical but often overlooked layer of healthcare.
