**UltraLinQ (<a href="https://www.ultralinq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ultralinq.com</a>)** is a cloud-based PACS platform.

PACS stands for Picture Archiving and Communication System. It is used to store, view, and share medical images. Before PACS, medical images were literal films. They were slow to produce, lossy, and had to be physically carried between providers. PACS digitized this process.

UltraLinQ gives clients the ability to read, store, report, and archive medical imaging anytime and from anywhere with an internet connection. Its clients include cardiology practices, hospitals, imaging centers, imaging schools, and multi-site healthcare systems.


### My Perspective
PACS is not new. It originated in the 1980s. Key vendors today include [Sectra](https://sectra.com) (Sweden), [Visage Imaging](https://visageimaging.com) (San Diego, CA), [GE HealthCare](https://www.gehealthcare.com) (Chicago, IL), and [Fujifilm](https://healthcaresolutions-us.fujifilm.com) (Japan). UltraLinQ (New York, NY) has been around for about 15 years. What differentiates it is focus: a cloud-native approach built around speed, access, and sharing across organizations and providers.

While radiology was the earliest adopter of PACS, UltraLinQ has focused on cardiology. Cardiology workflows are often more time-sensitive, as delays in reviewing cardiac imaging can directly affect treatment decisions. Instant image sharing across institutions can reduce time to diagnosis and potentially time to treatment.

In August 2025, [Core Sound Imaging](https://www.corestudycast.com/) (Raleigh, NC), which owns another PACS platform called Studycast, acquired UltraLinQ. Beyond scale, this merger may bring more aggregated imaging data and broader workflows onto a single platform. Increased data density could unlock additional value through integrations such as UltraLinQ’s partnership with [iCardio.ai](https://www.icardio.ai) (Los Angeles, CA), which focuses on AI-assisted echocardiography.
