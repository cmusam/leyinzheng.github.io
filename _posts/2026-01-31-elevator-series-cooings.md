**Cooings (<a href="https://www.cooings.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cooings.com</a>)** connects families with postpartum doula support designed to help new mothers recover and adjust after birth. It focuses on practical, day-to-day needs during the “fourth trimester,” including physical recovery, emotional well-being, and confidence-building during early motherhood.

On the service side, Cooings offers postpartum support such as newborn sleep help, breastfeeding and lactation guidance, and physical and emotional recovery services.

On the business model side, Cooings appears to combine direct pay with benefits-driven reimbursement. The company lists postpartum doula pricing at $55/hour, and supports HSA/FSA payments, superbills, and partnerships with benefit platforms such as Carrot, Maven, and Progyny.

### My Perspective
Postpartum care is an area where demand is real, but access is inconsistent. The core value here is not new clinical innovation, but coordination and reliability. If Cooings can consistently match families with high-quality support—and make payment and reimbursement simple—it addresses a meaningful gap during a high-stress and underserved period of care.
