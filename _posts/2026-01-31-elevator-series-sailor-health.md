**Sailor Health** is a mental health platform built for older adults. This population faces high rates of anxiety and depression but limited access to care. An estimated 70% of older adults do not receive the mental health support they need. Finding an in-network therapist is especially difficult.

Sailor Health addresses this gap by connecting seniors with licensed therapists trained in geriatric care. The company supports patients throughout the care journey. Its model is designed around Medicare, guided navigation, and age-specific needs. By focusing on access and usability, Sailor Health improves engagement and continuity of care in an underserved market.
