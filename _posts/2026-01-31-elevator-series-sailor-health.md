**Sailor Health** (<a href="https://www.sailorhealth.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sailorhealth.com</a>) (sailorhealth.com) is a mental health platform built for older adults. Seniors face high rates of anxiety and depression but limited access to care. Around 70% of older adults do not receive the mental health support they need. Finding in-network therapists is difficult.

Sailor Health connects seniors with licensed therapists trained in geriatric care. The company supports patients throughout the care journey. Its model is designed around Medicare, guided navigation, and age-specific needs. By focusing on access and usability, Sailor Health improves engagement and continuity of care in an underserved market.
